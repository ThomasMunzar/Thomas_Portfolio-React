          Hello! My name is Thomas Munzar, I am from Oakland California and am excited to start my career in web development.  I studied environmental science at SF State and then fell in love with cooking.
          I have working in many kitchens in the Bay Area but am now making a career change to web development. I studied web development at UC Berkeley Extention Coding Bootcamp. It was extremely challenging 
          but I enjoyed the entire process. Learning this new skill is extremely rewarding and I am excited to learn so much more as I start my journey.
